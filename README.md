-First, in a large bowl mix together 1.5 teaspoons instant yeast and ½ teaspoon of sugar.

- Add 1 cup of lukewarm water (44 degrees Celsius) and stir. Set aside and let the yeast activate.

-You should start to see the yeast mixture bubbling up and doubling in size after about 10 to 15 minutes.

- Combine 1 cup of unbleached all purpose flour (or bread flour) with 1 teaspoon of salt and 3 tablespoons of olive oil.

- Stir with a spoon or a whisk then add one more cup of flour.

-Keep stirring the mixture would be quite sticky.

 -Add the last cup of flour and continue to stir. The dough will start to form and leave the sides of the bowl, but will still be sticky.

 -Now its time to knead the dough

 -Lastly keep it in a bowl covered with a cloth for about 45min-1hr,if using instant yeast.


 2)ASSEMBLING AND BAKING
  -First, preheat the oven to the highest temperature in your oven.

  - Grease a round metal baking pan with olive oil, and then lightly dust it with maize flour .

  -Using clean, dry hands, take one portion of the divided dough and roll it into a neat round ball. 

  -  Use a rolling pin to roll the dough ball into a large round or oval shape of about ⅛ to ¼ inch thickness.
  tip-You may have to dust the surface with flour as you work.

  - Once stretched to the desired size, gently place the pizza base in the greased baking pan. Be careful not to tear the dough, as it is very soft and stretchy.

  -Use a pastry brush to lightly brush the surface of the crust with olive oil.

  - Then, spread the tomato sauce on the pizza in a thin, even layer
  tip- Leave about an inch of dough around the outer edge free from sauce for a perfect pizza crust.

-. Bake the veg pizza in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until the cheese melts and the crust is golden.
